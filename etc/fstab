# Bedrock Linux 1.0alpha2 /etc/fstab
#
# Things which should be mounted at boot go here.  Additionally, things which
# should be mounted to share between clients should be placed here.
#
# It is recommended to make the core Bedrock accessible as a client as well, so
# that it can be accessed from within other clients.  This is the only item
# described herein which should be mounted at boot.  To do so, uncomment the
# following line (optionally changing /var/chroot/bedrock to where you would
# like to place the bedrock client).
#
#/  /var/chroot/bedrock  bind  defaults,bind  0  0
#
# For the items which should be shared, two special options need to be given:
# "noauto" and "user" - the first specifies that the items are not mounted at
# boot, and the second allows non-root users to mount the items.
#
# Most clients will require access to /proc, /dev (and its subdirectories) and
# /sys.  To make these acessible in a bedrock client, uncomment the following:
#
#/proc     /var/chroot/bedrock/proc     proc    noauto,user,exec,nosuid           0  0
#/dev      /var/chroot/bedrock/dev      bind    noauto,user,exec,dev,bind,nosuid  0  0
#/dev/pts  /var/chroot/bedrock/dev/pts  devpts  noauto,user,exec,dev,nosuid       0  0
#/dev/shm  /var/chroot/bedrock/dev/shm  bind    noauto,user,exec,dev,bind,nosuid  0  0
#/sys      /var/chroot/bedrock/sys      sysfs   noauto,user,exec,dev,nosuid       0  0
#
# Other things which are recommended to be shared:
#
# Ensures client can itself prepare other clients:
#/etc/fstab           /var/chroot/bedrock/etc/fstab            bind   noauto,user,bind,nosuid           0  0
#/opt/bedrock         /var/chroot/bedrock/opt/bedrock          bind   noauto,user,bind,exec,suid        0  0
#/var/chroot          /var/chroot/bedrock/var/chroot           bind   noauto,user,bind,exec,suid        0  0
#/var/chroot/bedrock  /var/chroot/bedrock/var/chroot/bedrock   bind   noauto,user,bind,exec,suid        0  0
# Ensures clients properly integrate users:
#/etc/group           /var/chroot/bedrock/etc/group            bind   noauto,user,bind,nosuid           0  0
#/etc/passwd          /var/chroot/bedrock/etc/passwd           bind   noauto,user,bind,nosuid           0  0
#/etc/shadow          /var/chroot/bedrock/etc/shadow           bind   noauto,user,bind,nosuid           0  0
#/etc/profile         /var/chroot/bedrock/etc/profile          bind   noauto,user,bind,nosuid           0  0
#/home                /var/chroot/bedrock/home                 bind   noauto,user,bind,exec,nosuid      0  0
#/root                /var/chroot/bedrock/root                 bind   noauto,user,bind,exec,nosuid      0  0
# Needed for many applications:
#/etc/hostname        /var/chroot/bedrock/etc/hostname         bind   noauto,user,bind,nosuid           0  0
#/etc/hosts           /var/chroot/bedrock/etc/hosts            bind   noauto,user,bind,nosuid           0  0
#/etc/resolv.conf     /var/chroot/bedrock/etc/resolv.conf      bind   noauto,user,bind,nosuid           0  0
# Not overly much reason to keep these unique per client:
#/etc/sudoers         /var/chroot/bedrock/etc/sudoers          bind   noauto,user,bind,nosuid           0  0
#/tmp                 /var/chroot/bedrock/tmp                  bind   noauto,user,bind,exec,nosuid      0  0
#/usr/src             /var/chroot/bedrock/usr/src              bind   noauto,user,bind,exec,nosuid      0  0
#/boot                /var/chroot/bedrock/boot                 bind   noauto,user,bind,exec,nosuid      0  0
#
# Barring the first example item (/ /var/chroot/bedrock bind defaults,bind 0 0),
# all of the items described above should be created for every client which you
# would like fully integrated into the system (the exceptions being clients
# which you would like to sandbox).  Copy the entire block of items for each
# client, replacing the "/var/chroot/bedrock" which is at the beginning of the
# second column with the location of the newly-being-added client.
#
# Remember that each item described above, barring the first one, should have a
# corresponding mount line in /opt/bedrock/etc/brclients.conf
#
# Finally, /etc/fstab can be used as one would typically use it in a more
# standard Linux distribution.  If you would like to mount, say, a Windows
# partition on boot, or ensure users can automatically mount an optical disk
# drive, those will also need lines in this file.
